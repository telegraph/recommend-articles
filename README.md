# Recommend Articles Service

The Newsroom project is changing the way we produce content at Telegraph. One of the most important pieces of this 
project is our **Recommend Articles** engine which allow us to reference and link upcoming content with live content.

The **Recommend Articles** relies on Machine Learning to generate article recommendations. In the first approach, the 
algorithm will recommend articles based on the article's body.

In terms of structure, this project is composed by:
 * **Recommend Articles Engine** - code that trains and generates the data model to be used to recommend articles;
 * **Recommend Articles Engine API** - service that uses the data model to recommend articles;
 * **Recommend Articles API** - service that acts like a Facade and returns the recommend articles details;


## Description
The **Recommend Article Engine API** service makes use of the *data-frame* and *data-model*
generated by our **Recommend Article Engine**. This minimalistic micro-service is responsible 
for returning the *content-id* of the recommended articles given a specific article body. 


## Architecture
The following image depicts the architectural components used in this module:

## Rest API
Because this service exposes a Rest API, a Swagger definition is used to self document the service ([Swagger.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telegraph/platforms-swagger-specs/master/newsroom/recommend-articles-engine-api.yaml))

#### GET /health & GET /recommend-articles/health
This endpoint should be used by the load balancer to check if the service is up. 

##### Request
```
GET /recommend-articles/health
```

##### Response
```
StatusCode: 200
Content-Type: application/json
Payload:
{
    "status": "OK"
}
```

#### GET /recommend-articles/health/detailed 
This endpoint is used to get the service detailed health status. It contains information about all service dependencies 
and their connectivity. This status is cached in the service for a minute. Therefore, the *cached=true* query parameter
can be used to get a fresh status.

```
GET /recommend-articles/health/detailed?cached=true
